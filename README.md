# spotify_wrapped

This is a Python project I built to generate my own Spotify Wrapped whenever I want!
You might be wondering  "Why go through the trouble when Spotify already gives you one at the end of the year?"
Well, the answer is simple,  I didnâ€™t want to wait.

This Program tracks my top songs from the last month, last 6 months, and all time using spotifies api for developers and saves them to a google sheet using the google sheets API 

To make a friendly UI for this project I ended up using glide, an app that gives it that IOS feel t my program 
Features:
- retrieves top stracks from spotify
- extacts detailed track info: song name, album, artist, spotify url, album cover
- uploads data to a google sheet for easy sharing and storage

libraries:
- pip install spotipy, pandas, gpsread, outath2client
